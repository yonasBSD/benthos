            **Assumptions:**
            - All tools are functional and will work without error. Do not test tools or make exploratory calls. Make sure this is clear to every subagent that is launched.
            - Only call a tool if it is required to complete the task. Every tool call should have a clear purpose.

            **STEP 1: Commit Policy Validation**

            Fetch commit data using: `gh pr view $PR --json commits`

            For each commit, validate against commit policy:
            - **Granularity**: Each commit is one small, self-contained, logical change. Flag commits mixing unrelated work.
            - **Message format** (enforced): Must match one of these patterns:
              - `system: message` — lowercase system name matching a known area (e.g., `otlp: add authz support`, `kafka: fix consumer group rebalance`)
              - `system(subsystem): message` — same, with parenthesized subsystem (e.g., `gateway(authz): add http middleware`, `cli(mcp): handle shutdown`)
              - `chore: message` — low-importance cleanup, maintenance, or housekeeping changes (e.g., `chore: update gitignore`)
              - Sentence-case plain message for repo-wide changes not scoped to one system (e.g., `Bump to Go 1.26`, `Update CI workflows`). First word capitalized, rest lowercase unless proper noun.
              - `Revert "..."` and merge commits are exempt.
              In all cases, `message` starts lowercase and uses imperative mood (e.g., "add", "fix", not "added", "fixes").
            - **Message quality** (enforced): Flag messages that are vague ("fix stuff", "updates", "WIP"), misleading (title doesn't match the actual changes), or incomprehensible.
            - **Fixup/squash**: Flag unsquashed `fixup!`/`squash!` commits.

            Post commit policy violations as a SINGLE summary comment (not inline comments) listing all violations found. If no commit policy violations are found, do NOT post a commit policy comment.

            **STEP 2: Code Review**

            **CRITICAL: We only want HIGH SIGNAL issues.** Flag issues where:
            - Clear, unambiguous CLAUDE.md violations where you can quote the exact rule being broken
            - [Project Go patterns](.claude/agents/godev.md) violations: (single vs batch MustRegister*), ConfigSpec construction, field name constants, ParsedConfig extraction, Resources pattern, import organization, license headers, formatting/linting, error handling (wrapping with gerund form, %w), context propagation (no context.Background() in methods, no storing ctx on structs), concurrency patterns (mutex, goroutine lifecycle), shutdown/cleanup (idempotent Close, sync.Once), public wrappers, bundle registration, info.csv metadata, distribution classification
            - [Project Test patterns](.claude/agents/tester.md) violations:
                - Unit tests: table-driven tests with errContains, assert vs require, config parsing with MockResources, enterprise InjectTestService, processor/input/output/bloblang lifecycle tests, config linting, NewStreamBuilder pipelines, HTTP mock servers
                - Integration tests: integration.CheckSkip(t), Given-When-Then with t.Log(), testcontainers-go, NewStreamBuilder with AddBatchConsumerFunc, side-effect imports, async stream.Run with context.Canceled handling, assert.Eventually polling (no require inside), parallel subtest safety, cleanup with context.Background()
              Flag changed code lacking tests and new components without integration tests
            - Bugs and Security: Logic errors, nil dereferences, race conditions, resource leaks, SQL/command injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets

            Do NOT flag:
            - Code style or quality concerns
            - Potential issues that depend on specific inputs or state
            - Subjective suggestions or improvements

            If you are not certain an issue is real, do not flag it. False positives erode trust and waste reviewer time.

            Create a list of all comments that you plan on leaving. This is only for you to make sure you are comfortable with the comments. Do not post this list anywhere.

            Post inline comments for each issue using `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment`. For each comment:
              - Provide a brief description of the issue
              - For small, self-contained fixes, include a committable suggestion block
              - For larger fixes (6+ lines, structural changes, or changes spanning multiple locations), describe the issue and suggested fix without a suggestion block
              - Never post a committable suggestion UNLESS committing the suggestion fixes the issue entirely. If follow up steps are required, do not leave a committable suggestion.

              **IMPORTANT: Only post ONE comment per unique issue. Do not post duplicate comments.**

            Use this list when evaluating issues (these are false positives, do NOT flag):
            - Pre-existing issues
            - Something that appears to be a bug but is actually correct
            - Pedantic nitpicks that a senior engineer would not flag
            - Issues that a linter will catch (do not run the linter to verify)
            - General code quality concerns (e.g., lack of test coverage, general security issues) unless explicitly required in CLAUDE.md
            - Issues mentioned in CLAUDE.md but explicitly silenced in the code (e.g., via a lint ignore comment)

            Notes:
            - Use gh CLI to interact with GitHub (e.g., fetch pull requests, create comments). Do not use web fetch.
            - Create a todo list before starting.
            - You must cite and link each issue in inline comments (e.g., if referring to a CLAUDE.md, include a link to it).
            - If no code review issues are found, post a comment with the following content: "LGTM"
            - Links must follow this exact format for GitHub Markdown rendering: `https://github.com/redpanda-data/connect/blob/[full-sha]/path/file.ext#L[start]-L[end]`
              - Full git SHA required (not abbreviated, not a command like `$(git rev-parse HEAD)`)
              - `#L` notation after filename
              - Line range format: `L[start]-L[end]`
              - Include at least 1 line of context before and after
