            Before running the review, load agent definitions into context since named agents may not be available in CI:
            - Read `.claude/agents/godev.md` and use its content as context when launching the godev review agent.
            - Read `.claude/agents/tester.md` and use its content as context when launching the tester review agent.

            Then run: /review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
